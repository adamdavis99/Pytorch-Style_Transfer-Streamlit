# Basic Deepart Pytorch Streamlit App [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/adamdavis99/pytorch-style_transfer-streamlit/streamlit_main.py)

Made with Streamlit ❤️

### Original inspiration : [Deepart](https://deepart.io)

### Pytorch implementation of Fast Style Transfer along with models have been downloaded from : [Pytorch Fast Style Transfer](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style)

### Original paper : [ Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155). [Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf) has also been used for training the models.

#### You can download all the saved models from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrvwfehqdcxoza8/saved_models.zip?dl=0).

## What the heck is style-transfer
Style transfer is a computer vision technique that allows us to recompose the content of an image in the style of another. If you’ve ever imagined what a photo might look like if it were painted by a famous artist, then style transfer is the computer vision technique that turns this into a reality.
